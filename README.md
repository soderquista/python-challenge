# python-challenge
This denotes the Python challenge for introductory methods of analysis given .csv data/files, and crafted data measurement across two different challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.

## PyBank
Tasked with creating a Python script to analyze financial records of a simulated company given a financial dataset 'budget_data.csv'. Analyzed records to record total months of dataset, Net Profit/Losses, Average Change of Profit (per month), and greatest increase and decrease in profits, recording the date and amount from the entire period. Prints analysis to terminal and also exports to a text file with the results.

## PyPoll
Tasked with helping a small town modernize its vote-counting process, given a set of poll data 'election_data.csv' consisting of Voter ID, County, and Candidate columns. Analyzed total number of votes cast, list of candidates voted for, percentage and number of votes each candidate won, and who won the election. Prints analysis to terminal and also exports a text file with the results.
